# different varieties of continuous time
# and discrete time branching processes
# with different waiting time distributions
# and offspring distributions.

# each with different # of potential offspring


# generational galton-watson

# continuous time poisson process

# continuous time lognormal waiting

# continuous time lognormal waiting for division
# with poisson differentation process?
